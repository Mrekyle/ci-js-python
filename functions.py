# Defining functions in Python is different to JS. Firstly to define a function you use the def keyword and then the functions name.
# They can also take different paramaters like JS inside the brackets. Then by using indentation you tell the language that the code 
# belongs to the function above. 

def print_message():
    print('Hello World')

print_message() # Calls the function of print message. Similar to the way JS Functions are called
