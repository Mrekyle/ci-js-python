"""
Args and Kwarks are features that allow multiple arguments to be passed to functions. Using the preceding characters of *args or 
**kwarks. They can be renamed to allow for better readability as long as it relates to the intended use. Like below

*args - is an immutable object, thus it cant be changed and will always stay the same. This is because it is a tuple. the '*' allows
the tuple to be unpacked and the values passed through.

**kwarks - acts like a dictionary. Allowing the data to be read easily. As long at the '**' is used preceding the name it allows the data
to be read and passed through to the function.
