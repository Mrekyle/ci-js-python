# Same as console.log in JS. Using print statments throughout the code is a good way to catch errors and to see what is going on quickly

print('Hello World')

# System Exit cuts the code and exits the application safely. Just like powering down a pc using the correct process not pulling the plug out

raise SystemExit('Some error Message')
# The above pauses and exits the code based on the statement before its process. Allowing us to look at the errors/place it is at in the code to 
# help catch any bugs or errors 

# Errors

#print 'Hello, World!' Will throw an error as its not correct syntax for the python language. There mut be the brackets in the statment for it to 
# read the code and print the desired outcome

# Variables are defined differently to JS. They are also case sensitive. They can also contain spaces, by using an underscore. Meaning.

myvar = 5 
my_var = 5
# Is a different variable to 
myVar = 5
my_Var = 5
# all of the above variables are completely different despite essentially having the same names and values assigned to them

# True/False
# In Python Booleans are defined by using the true and false keywords. But the first letter of each must be capataised
