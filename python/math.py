# Mathmatic operators are essentially the same as they are in Js with a few exceptions

# With the modulo operator returing the remainer of the sum ie.. And will always return a integer (whole number)

# 18 % 7 = 4 as the remainder of the sum is 4


# With the division operator it will always return a float. Even if the sum will return a whole number. 
# But we can get around this by using the floor division operator '//' Which will round the float down to the whole number 

# Incrementing and decrementing and reassigning are also possible inside of python. By using the '=' directly next to the mathmatic operator
# We can re asign the update date to its variable such as x += 5
