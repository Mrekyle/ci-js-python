"""
Classes are a lot like functions in the way they need to be defined by a certain keyword and called upon. They follow some rules such as
They must have a capital letter for the first letter of the name and must have docstring.

They allow us to hold large pieces of information such as multiple car objects.

Docstrings can br created with either the double quotation marks or the single quotation marks.
"""


class HelloWorld:
    '''A docstring must be created inside of the class. And must be indented in the same scope to be inside the defining area'''
    print('Hello World')


"""
When a class holds a function inside of it. It is referred to as a method of that class. 

Using the __init__() function allows us to create an object with certain parameters. Such as creating a car object.
